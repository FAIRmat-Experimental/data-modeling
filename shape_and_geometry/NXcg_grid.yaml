    A base class representing a d-dimensional grid of Wigner-Seitz cells.
    
    Frequently convenient three-dimensional grids with cubic cells are used.
    Examples applications are crystal plasticity and stencil methods like 
    phase field or cellular automata.

    doc: "Integer which specifies the first index to be used for distinguishing
    identifier of cells. Cells are indexed either implicitly or explicitly.
    For implicit indexing identifiers are on the interval [identifier_offset, identifier_offset+c-1].
    For explicit indexing the identifier array has to be used. 
    The identifier_offset describes e. g. if cell IDs start from 1 (also referred to as the Fortran-), 
    from 0 (also referred to as C-, Python-style notation), or from a different
    offset, which is best suited to support the description respectively."
