    A base class to define a point in a 1-4 D space
     
    A point is the end point of a vector from 0 to the point defined
    by the list of coordinates. This class allows the user to give this
    array. The zero point i.e. the coordinate system has to be defined
    independently at a higher level.
    Dimensionality -- A vector can be 1-3 numbers, and a time point
    if time is specified, it is always the last coordinate!

  point(NX_NUMBER):
    dox: an array of coordinates with or without time
  dimensions(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: the number of dimensions, the length of the array
    @value: N_array

  time_specified(NX_BOOLEAN):
    doc: is time included? If so, time is the last coordinate

  time_units:
    doc: in what unit is time provided? It should be any of NX_TIME
