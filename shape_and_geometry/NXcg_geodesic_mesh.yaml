    Base class to describe details about a specific geodesic mesh.
    
    People from geodesic/surveyors will likely have specific demands and 
    different views what should be included in such a base class, given that
    nested geodesic mesh are a key component of climate modelling tools.
    Discussions with NFDI-Earth could make this base class more meaty and detailed.
    
    For the time being, we use the base class as a wrapper to specify how a 
    geodesic surface mesh was instantiated, as there are many possibilities
    and a geodesic surface mesh is in this sense a triangulated surface mesh
    with special meta data. See e.g. E. S. Popko and C. J. Kitrick for details
