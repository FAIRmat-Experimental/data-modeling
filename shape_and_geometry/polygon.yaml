parameters:
  N_points: the length of the polygon
  N_dim: dimension of the point vectors

    A base class to define a polygon in a 1 - 4 dimensional space
     
    A polygon is a series of points connected together in the sequence
    they are specified.

  polygon(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: an array of points defining the nodes of a polygon. The dimension of eacy point
      i.e. how many coordinates are set must be uniform. We specify for now the end result as a
      2D array, but each row is a point. N_dim can be 1 - 4 any value.
      time is defined in the point class.
    dimennsions:
      rank: 2
      dim:[[1, N_dim],[2, N_points]]
    unit: NX_LENGTH, NX_TIME
  
  time_specified(NX_BOOLEAN):
