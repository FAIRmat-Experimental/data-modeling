  doc: |
    A base class to document metadata and data about a used marching cubes.
    
    Documenting which specific version was used can help to understand how robust
    the results are with respect to the topology of the triangulation.

    doc: "Link to the grid on which the marching cubes algorithm is operating."
  implementation:
    doc: |
      Reference to the specific implementation of marching cubes used.
      
      See the following papers for details to identify a DOI to put in this field
      which specifies which implementation was used
      * https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cag.2006.07.021
      * https://doi.org/10.1109/MCG.2020.2971284
      The value placed here should be a DOI

      doc: "Version and build number which details the rule set and handling of topological inconsistencies."
    # we could also think to store the rule sets in here explicitly including the coordinate system conventions
    # the problem is that commercial software like Matlab does not expose the rule set and thus 
    # such a field cannot be fillded
    # one could use an enumeration to narrow down
