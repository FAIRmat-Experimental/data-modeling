    Draft of a base class to describe delocalization of a point cloud on a grid.
    
    Such a procedure is for instance used in image processing and atom probe 
    microscopy (APM) to discretize a point cloud on a grid to enable e.g. 
    computing of point density, composition, or concentration values, obtain 
    scalar fields, and compute gradients of these fields.

  # for APM the speciality is nothing but:
  # each point marks the location of an ion in the tomographic reconstruction
  # there is a boolean mask which filters which ions, i.e. points are considered
  # plus there is a weight interpretation model, specifically in atom probe
  # if a (molecular) ion is decomposed into its atoms or isotopes
  # plus, given there is such a weight interpretation model, there is a weight
  # associated, specifically an integer >= 1 with each considered ion and 0 for
  # all ions which are not considered, 
  # this weight is the multiplicity with respect to the interpretation model
  # i.e. a C:2 molecular ion has a multiplicity of 2 if the ion is considered
  # and the interpretation model that to consider carbon atoms or carbon ions

  weighting_model:
    doc: |
      The weighting model specifies how mark data map to a weight per point.
      For APM different models are used which account for the multiplicity of an ion:
      * default, points all get the same weight 1.; for APM this is equivalent to ion species,
      * atomic_decomposition, points get as much weight as they have atoms of type in element_whitelist,
      * isotope_decomposition, points get as much weight as they have isotopes of type in isotope_whitelist.
    enumeration: [default, atomic_decomposition, isotope_decomposition] # other
    # can one conditionally set a field required if a weighting_model has a specific value,
    # i.e. if atomic_decomposition is set element_whitelist t is required
    # i.e. if isotope_decomposition is set isotope_whitelist is required?
