# the benefit of NXcg_point_set is that the origin is 0 by default
# if we were to store the origin though, and the coordinate system (where in the base class or outside)
# we could use the NXcg_point_set really a vector_set where the origin can 
# differ from 0
# this would enable then to make NXcg_unit_normal_set an essentially NXcg_point_set
# the problem is oftentimes storing the origin is really not needed and redundant
# information, for points exactly so in this case equipping an NXcg_point_set with
# an origin would this not be Basic class to define a point or better the end point of a vector
# in a 1-4 D space. This is a fundamental class in any geometry systems.
