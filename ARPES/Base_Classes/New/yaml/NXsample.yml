    doc: "A descriptor to keep track of the treatment of the sample before entering
      the photoemission experiment. Ideally, a full report of the previous operations,
      in any format (NXnote allows to add pictures, audio, movies). Alternatively,
      a reference to the location or a unique identifier or other metadata file. In
      the case these are not available, free-text description"
