    A base class draft to describe a chemical substance

    In [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance) you find the definition
    as: a form of matter having constant chemical composition and characteristic properties.
    It cannot be separated to its constituent elements by physical means, that is without
    breaking chemical bonds.
    In this current draft, we include chemical elements, compounds and alloys as possibilities.
    Materials described in this class are possible input and output components of chemical reactions
    e.g. in chemical synthesis processes.
    This base class can be also used to describe any components of samples used for measurements.

    An important usage of this class is to form a mixture, e.g. a solution or alloy from several
    substances. Therefore space is provided here to specify an amount and resulted concentration
    of this substance in that mixture formed. When looking only on this class, it may be not
    clear, but when looking at all substances listed together, the composition of the resulted
    sample becomes clear.
    For a proper hierarchy, we shall also need an NXchemical_compound class formed as a list
    of these chemical substances.
