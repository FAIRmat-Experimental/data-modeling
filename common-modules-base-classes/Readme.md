# common modules, base classes
There are a couple of components required in every experiments we describe, such as:
- experimenter
- sample description (name, ID, source, etc.)

Now, let us collect here modules that are required in every tasks of Aarea A, but may not have been written by other Areas so far.
For example: chemical substances.

# removing experimenter
the experimenter file was a redo of NXuser. Tune the NXuser instead as it is needed.

# sample types (qualification)
Sample types as already listed in Andreas presentation in task force meeting on 16th of May 2022:

- simple substance (element od chemical compound)
- mixture (or single phase mixture, solution, suspension, alloy or colloid)
- multi phase sample (multi domain or composite)
- layer (or film or substrate)
