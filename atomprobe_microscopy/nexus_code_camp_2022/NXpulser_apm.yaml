    (NXtransformations):
      doc: |
        Affine transformations which describe the geometry how the
        laser focusing optics/pinhole-attached coordinate system is
        defined, how it has to be transformed so that it aligns with
        the specimen coordinate system.
        A right-handed Cartesian coordinate system, the so-called laser space,
        should be assumed, whose positive z-axis points
        into the direction of the propagating laser beam.
