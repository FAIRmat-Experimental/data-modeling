    doc: "Ion type (ion species) identifier. The identifier zero is reserved for the special unknown ion type."

  isotope_vector(NX_UINT):
    doc: "A vector of isotope hash values. These values have to be stored in a decreasingly sorted array. The array is filled with zero hash values indicating unused places. The individual hash values are built with the following hash function: Hashvalue = Z + N*256 with Z the number of protons and N the number of neutrons of the isotope respectively. Z and N have to be 8-bit unsigned integers."

  charge_state(NX_INT):
    doc: "Signed charge state of the ion in multiples of the elementary electron charge. Only positive values will be measured in atom probe microscopy as the ions are accelerated by a negatively signed bias electric field. In the case that the charge state is not explicitly recoverable, the value should be set to zero. This is for example the case when using classical range file formats like RNG, RRNG for atom probe data. These file formats do not document the charge state explicitly but report an integer with the atom type which can be used to compute the charge state via the theoretically-known mass-to-charge-state-ratios of the elements."
    unit: NX_DIMENSIONLESS
  name:
    doc: "Human-readable ion type name (e.g. Al +++), i.e. ASCII UTF-8 character array, ideally using LaTeX notation to specify the ion and charge state. Examples are 12C+ or Al+++. Although this name may be human-readable and intuitive, parsing such names becomes impractical for more complicated cases. Therefore, the isotope_vector should be the preferred machine-readable format in use."
  mass_to_charge_range(NX_FLOAT):
    doc: "Associated lower (mqmin) and upper (mqmax) bounds of mass-to-charge-state ratio interval(s) [mqmin, mqmax] (boundaries included) for which the respective ion is labelled as an ion of the here referred to ion_type."
