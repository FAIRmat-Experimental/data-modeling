# General synthesis data structure concept
# In this document we collect the conclusions from our weekly synthesis data discussion.


- general information:
    # general metadata of the sample preparation
    - description of synthesis experiment (e.g. material system / grown material, targeted crystal size, external fields (magneticâ€¦), seed direction)
    - date
    - responsible person (staff/grower)

- setup:
    # description of all used equipment for the sample preparation or preparation environment
    - description of synthesis environment:
        - details of used equipment
            - user
            - ...
        - condition of equipment
        
- process:
    # description of the process including, starting material, pre-process and post-process steps
    - substrate or seed material
    
    - pre-process: 
        # pretreatments: e.g. substrate prepretreatment, target preparation (--> link to setup), preparation of catalysis solution
        
    - growth/process: 
        # main proces of sample preparation
        - steps of synthesis process:
            - set parameter values
            - actual parameter values
            - in situ measurement (from link to characterization section)
        
    - post-process:
        # post treatment, sample children, etc.    
        -...
    
- Characterization (experiment):
    # description of the characterization methods and its results
    - methode
        - description
        - measurement
        - ...
