# General synthesis data structure concept
# In this document we collect the conclusions from our weekly synthesis data discussion.

- general information:
    # general metadata of the sample preparation
    - description:
        - targeted material:
            - value:  
            - optional subcategories: #e.g.: targeted crystal size, external fields (magneticâ€¦), seed direction
        - synthesis category: melt | gas phase | assembly | solid phase and solution | ?
        - synthesis methode: #list dependend on selection of category and optional text
    - date: 
        # start date of synthesis
        -  year, month, day
        # time only at process steps --> timestamp
