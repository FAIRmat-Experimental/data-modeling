  Application definition for temperature-dependent IV curve measurements.
  
  In this application definition, times should be specified always together
  with an UTC offset.
  
  This is the application definition describing temperature dependent IV curve
  measurements. For this a temperature is set. After reaching the temperature,
  a voltage sweep is performed. For each voltage a current is measured.
  Then, the next desired temperature is set and an IV measurement is performed.
  The application definition defines:
  - elements of the experimental instrument
  - calibration information if available
  - parameters used to tune the state of the sample
  - sample description

              Proportional term. The proportional term produces an output value
              that is proportional to the current error value.
              The proportional response can be adjusted by multiplying the error
              by a constant Kp, called the proportional gain constant.
          K_i_value(NX_NUMBER):

              The contribution from the integral term is proportional to both
              the magnitude of the error and the duration of the error.
              The integral in a PID controller is the sum of the instantaneous
              error over time and gives the accumulated offset that should have
              been corrected previously. The accumulated error is then
              multiplied by the integral gain (Ki) and added to the
              controller output.
