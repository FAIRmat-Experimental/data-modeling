MBEsystem
collection of sources
source: orifice diameter, distance to substrate, polar angle to substrate normal, azimutal angle
source/effusion cell: charge, emitted species (what molecules), T(Â°C), BEP(mbar), flux(nm^-2s^-1)
source/gas injector: what gas (incl mixtures), flow-rate (sccm)
source/plasma source: gas injector + plasma power
substrate rotation
substrate heater (T_sub)
T_sub (TC, pyro, other)
chamber pressure
chamber mass spectrum


substrate (similar to methods)

process = sequence of steps

step:
duration
T_sub (t)
open-cells (T, BEP, flux, plasma power) (t)
chamber pressure or mass spectra (t)
