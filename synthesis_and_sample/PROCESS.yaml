  MATERIALS:
    doc: |
      list here all the materials that are used in the process,
      they may belong to SAMPLE or SUBSTANCE classes.
      Several kinds of materials are shown below.
    rod:
    consumables(SAMPLE):
    precursor(SAMPLE):
    Ethanol(SUBSTANCE):
    Iridium(SUBSTANCE):
    HCl(SUBSTANCE):

          concentration: 
          Iridium(SUBSTANCE):
    intended_sample(SAMPLE): to be defined
      doc: targeted/intended sample with optional properties
      bool: True/False
    final_sample(SAMPLE):
      composition:
        layer_1(SAMPLE):
          process_step_link: we may link the single layer to a specific step in the process
        layer_2(SAMPLE):
          process_step_link: we may link the single layer to a specific step in the process

  STEPS:
    doc: |
      Each action pursued during the process should be placed here with a timestamp pin.
      A step can be a preparation step or even a monitoring measurement carried out after the start of the process.
      The timestamp is fundamental as it allows to plot all the quantities one would like to monitor in the same time abscissa.
    step_type: Enum [pre-process, process, post-process, measurement, storage] 
      doc: |
        Each step should belong to a step type

    step_information: could be information about a layer
    REAGENTS:
