    A base class draft to describe the amount, concentration 
    or generally the QUANTIFICATION of a SAMPLE or SUBSTANCE.

    This class is decorating the existing SAMPLE or SUBSTANCE
    with some features that are not intrinsic of the material itself.
    E. g. : how much of my chemical do I use in a specific synthesis
  timestamp:

      may be needed in some use case
  fabrication_date:
    doc: |
      Date of preparation
  mass:
    unit: mg
    doc: |
      Mass of the powder precursor weighted out in the glove box
  amount_type:
    doc: |
      How was the substance provided? By mass, by volume, by molar amount, in solution,
      in a mixture..."
    enumeration: [by mass, by volume, molar]
  amount:
    unit: mmol
    doc: |
      Amount of substance of precursor powder weighted out
  volume_solvent:
    unit: ml
    doc: |
      Volume of solvent used to solve the powder precursor
  mass_concentration:
    unit: g/L
    doc: |
      Mass concentration of the prepared precursor-solvent solution
  concentration_type:
    doc: |
      what concentration was used?
    enumeration: [mass %, volume %, mass/volume %, mol %, molarity, molality]
  concentration:
    doc: |
      Amount of substance concentration of the prepared precursor-solvent solution
    unit: mmol/L
