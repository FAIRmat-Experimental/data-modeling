    A base class draft to describe a chemical compound formed from chemical substances

    This class describes any materials used for experiments formed by a set of substances,
    which may be in any state, that is liquid, solid, etc. form.
  chemical_name:
    doc: |
      The name of the material
  SUBSTANCE:
    doc: A REFERENCE to the chemical separate entry

    # let's discuss where to describe the amount and concentrattion:
    # E. G. I have my NaCl solution in water whose concentration is described in the "chemical_substance_or_component",
    # I take a teaspoon from that bottle to compose my "chemical_specimen_or_material"
    # where to indicate that?
    # the idea was to extend the SUBSTANCE base class with the following quantities only when it is invoked as a camponent of a MATERIAL

  comment:
    doc: |
      Remarks about the chemical beyond the typically collected information.
      Here you can collect information about your experience using this chemical,
      for example if it might have been contaminated during an experiment

  # now, outside the COMPONENTs, we still have to tell how much of this compound we
  # use for whatever purposes
  # we could do the same here, extending this class when it is instanciated in the upper SAMPLE level
