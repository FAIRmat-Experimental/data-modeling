    A base class draft to describe a chemical compound formed from chemical substances
    
    This class describes any materials used for experiments formed by a set of substances,
    which may be in any state, that is liquid, solid, etc. form.

  general(to be moved in the general sample class): 
    name:
      doc: "name of the compound"
      exists: required
    category(or qualification or type):
    chemical_formula:
    molecular_weight:
    COMPONENT(NXsample):

  # now, outside the COMPONENTs, we still have to tell how much of this compound we
  # use for whatever purposes:
  state:
    doc: "State of the compound, e.g. solid, liquid, gas, plasma"
    enumeration: [solid, liquid, gas, plasma]
  amount_type:
    doc: "how is this compound provided? By mass, by volume, by molar amount, in solution,
        in a mixture..."
    enumeration: [by mass, by volume, molar]
  amount(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: "Amount with a unit corresponding to the above amount type"
  concentration_type:
    exists: only required if this compound is part of a mixture(NXsample)
    doc: "what concentration was used?"
    enumeration: [mass %, volume %, mass/volume %, mol %, molarity, molality]
  concentration(NX_NUMBER):
    exists: only required if this compound is part of a mixture(NXsample)
    doc: "and the corresponding number"
    exists: required
