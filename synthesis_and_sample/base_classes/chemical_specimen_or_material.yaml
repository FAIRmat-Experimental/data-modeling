    A base class draft to describe a chemical compound formed from chemical substances
    
    This class describes any materials used for experiments formed by a set of substances,
    which may be in any state, that is liquid, solid, etc. form.
  name:
    doc: "name of the compound, possibly specifying characteristic concentrations as well"
    exists: required

  (chemical_substance or component):
    doc: "the individual components of this material, including their corresponding concentrations
          here we also recite some components of the NXchemical_substance base class, because they
          are now required!"
    state:
      doc: "State of the compound, e.g. solid, liquid, gas, plasma"
      exists: required
      enumeration: [solid, liquid, gas, plasma]
    amount_type:
      doc: "how was the substance provided? By mass, by volume, by molar amount, in solution,
        in a mixture..."
      exists: required
      enumeration: [by mass, by volume, molar]
    concentration_type:
      doc: "what concentration was used?"
      enumeration: [mass %, volume %, mass/volume %, mol %, molarity, molality]
    concentration(NX_NUMBER):
      doc: "and the corresponding number"
      exists: required

  # now, outside the COMPONENTs, we still have to tell how much of this compound we
  # use for whatever purposes:
