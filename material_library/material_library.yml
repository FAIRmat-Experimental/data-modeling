# This is a draft for an application defition or base class for materials libraries. 
# Inspiration taken from the Kameleont database project at Unold Lab.

material_library:
  doc: "Sample in which in one or various properties can vary across the area of the substrate,
        thus containing subsamples whithin.
        An example would be a subtrate with a deposited film on top in which
        the chemical compostion of the film varies in the x and y directions."

  processess:
    doc: "Experimetal procedure which the sample gets altered or a new component is added to it.
          For example, in the context of thin films, a deposition of a new layer
          by evaporation is a process."

    spin_coating: 
      doc: "The process of deposition a film using a spin-coater.
            Typically, a small amount of solution is applied in the center of the subtrate,
            which is then spinned extending the material over its area"
    chemical_bath_deposition:
      doc: "Also known as chemical solution deposition and CBD.
            Is a thin film deposition method in which the substrate is introduced in a precursor solution"

 # Discuss whether these should be sub-grupped 
  measurements:
    doc: "Experimental procedure in which a material library or sample gets characterized by a technique.
          For example, a measurment by X-ray diffraction to characteriza the structural properties of an specimen
          or X-ray fluorescence to characteriza its composition."
