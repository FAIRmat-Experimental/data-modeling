# List of methods not represented in Area B

## Olivers pdi (for our activity on epitaxial layers)
1. **XRD** -> crystalline phases and domains, their orientation and quality metrics (rocking curve FWHM) 
2. **AFM** -> surface morphology, surface faceting
3. electrical transport properties (Resistivity + Hall)
	
Also important:
- **Raman spectroscopy**: -> phases (Manfred Ramsteiner)
