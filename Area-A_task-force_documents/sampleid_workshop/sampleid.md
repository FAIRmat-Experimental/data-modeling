# Convention for the generation of the full sample ID

The goal is to find a human readable sample id convention, which is simple, understandable and still having chances of becoming unique.

The ID consists of the following components:
* `institute`: Abreviation of the home institute of the sample owner e.g. `HZB`, `PDI`...
* `owner_alias`: alias of the owner of the sample, e.g. `oah`
* `creation_date`: Date of the creation of the sample in the form of `YYYYMMDD`
* `sample_short_name`: a short name of the sample (the identifier scribed on the smaple, or in the sample box), e.g. `4001-8`, `YAG-2-34`. This is to be managed and decided internally by the labs, although we recomend to avoid the following characters in it: "`_`", "`/`", "`\`" and "`.`" 

The individual components are seperated by underscores (`_`).  
Spaces in any of the individual components will be replaced with hyphens (`-`).

Full example for a full sample ID: `hzb_oah_20200602_4001-08`

# Convention for a **sub**sample `sample_short_name`

Sometimes, a sample gets divided to share a part with a collabotor or simply to perform further experiments in these dived parts. These divided parts then becaome sub samples. 

The subsamples short names will be generated by appending an hyphen (`-`) followed by a letter to the *parent* `sample_short_name`, e.g. `4001-8-a`, `4001-8-b` for an hypothetical parent sample with a `sample_short_name` of `4001-8`.
