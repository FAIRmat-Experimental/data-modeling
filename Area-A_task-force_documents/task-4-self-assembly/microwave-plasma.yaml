    doc: |
      Etching / activation step characterized by:
        - gas pressure
        - flow rate (optional)
        - power used for the microwave generator
        - gas type (typically H2, O2, N2, NH3, CH4, etc.)

  gas_type:
    doc: "free text description of the gas mixture used, e.g. O2 20 V%, H2 50 V%, etc.;
      always describe the whole mixture. Alternatively, a vague description as 'air' is
      also acceptable"
