Dear all,
in our Area A task force meeting next Monday we continue the discussion on our general PROCESS data structure (https://github.com/FAIRmat-Experimental/data-modeling/blob/main/synthesis_and_sample/PROCESS.yaml ). I suggest we focus on how to implement the intended sample (as planned in a synthesis recipe) and the final sample (as defined by characterization afterwards) in our data structure. 
Have a nice weekend,
Sebastian
