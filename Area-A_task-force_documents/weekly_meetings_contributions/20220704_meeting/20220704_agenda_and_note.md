# Area A task force meeting 04.07.2022

## Homework from Email

please read the updated meeting notes from our last task force meeting here: https://github.com/FAIRmat-Experimental/data-modeling/blob/4da7bc560ad0962a89b9eee5d309cce685d4fbe2/Area-A_task-force_documents/weekly_meetings_contributions/20220627_meeting/22060727_agenda_and_notes.md
As concluded, please test the PROCESS.yaml data concept on your own synthesis data. Please check the MOVPE_STO files for orientation. The data file might be most useful to look at. In the next meeting we would like to discuss your examples/experience.
If you need any help on this task, do not hesitate to contact me or my colleagues Andrea and Pepe.

## Agenda

- Andrea's presentation on the flexible schema and the [MOVPE_STO example](https://github.com/FAIRmat-Experimental/Area_A_application_definitions/tree/main/movpe_structured_example). 
- Application of the [PROCESS.yaml](https://github.com/FAIRmat-Experimental/data-modeling/blob/main/synthesis_and_sample/PROCESS.yaml) on [Fabians Synthesis example data](https://github.com/FAIRmat-Experimental/data-modeling/blob/main/Area-A_task-force_documents/weekly_meetings_contributions/20220509_meeting/SynthesisStructure_Example.txt) --> [resulting schema file](https://github.com/FAIRmat-Experimental/Area_A_application_definitions/blob/main/Synthesis_Fabian.yaml)


## Notes

All documents and files we discussed in this weeks meeting will uploaded to this folder. 
Fabian will edit his schema file and provide a data yaml file which should help other users to understand the dataset.
In the next meetings we will look at examples from all the different fiels in Area A to test our general data concept.
