Dear all,
based on the discussions in our Area A task force meeting we created some base classes related to the sample description in synthesis. We would like you to review and comment them in our Github folder. Please check the following issues we opened:
•	https://github.com/FAIRmat-Experimental/data-modeling/issues/22
•	https://github.com/FAIRmat-Experimental/data-modeling/issues/8

For the next task force meeting we suggest the following agenda:

Agenda:

- Github Issues on Sample, material, Substance:
    - Where to place the amount of substance (will be explained in the meeting)
	- Should impurity and doping be treated differently? (intentional vs. unintentional)
    - How to deal with a sample which is composed of another sample?
- Discuss PROCESS STEP.
    - Timestamp as fundamental pin to point your quantity in the same time abscissa
    - Different ways of describing a synthesis step


Details of the agenda will be discussed in the meeting.
See you on Monday,
Sebastian
