# Area A Task Force meeting 27.06.2022

## Agenda

Dear all,
in our Area A task force meeting next Monday we continue the discussion on our general PROCESS data structure (https://github.com/FAIRmat-Experimental/data-modeling/blob/main/synthesis_and_sample/PROCESS.yaml ). I suggest we focus on how to implement the intended sample (as planned in a synthesis recipe) and the final sample (as defined by characterization afterwards) in our data structure. 

## Meeting Notes

Discussion on [PROCESS.yaml](https://github.com/FAIRmat-Experimental/data-modeling/blob/main/synthesis_and_sample/PROCESS.yaml) regarding intended sample (as planned in a synthesis recipe) and the final sample (as defined by characterization afterwards) in our data structure. 

Andrea showed implementation of the PROCESS data structure concept in the MOVPE_STO example (data from IKZ Berlin). The schema and data files are stored [here](https://github.com/FAIRmat-Experimental/Area_A_application_definitions/tree/main/movpe_structured_example)

## Conclusion

All users are encouraged to test the PROCESS.yaml data concept on their own synthesis data. Please check the [MOVPE_STO files](https://github.com/FAIRmat-Experimental/Area_A_application_definitions/tree/main/movpe_structured_example) for orientation. The [data file](https://github.com/FAIRmat-Experimental/Area_A_application_definitions/blob/main/movpe_structured_example/movpe_app-def_data.archive.yaml) might be most useful to look at. In the next meeting we would like to discuss your examples/experience.
