  COATING(NXsample): 
  # Used captial letters for COATING so that more than one can be defined if
  # the lens has different coatings on the front and back side.
    doc: |
      If the lens has a coating describe the material and its properties.
      Some basic information can be found e.g. [here]
      (https://www.opto-e.com/basics/reflection-transmission-and-coatings).
      If the back and front side of the lens are coated with different
      materials, use separate COATING(NXsample) fields to describe the coatings
      on the front and back side, respectively. For example:
      coating_front(NXsample) and coating_back(NXsample).

      specify for which surface (e.g. front or back) the curvature is provided:
      e.g. curvature_front or curvature_back. The front face is the surface on
      which the light beam is incident, while the back face is the one from
      which the light beam exits the lens.
