  An optical fiber, e.g. glass fiber.

  Specify the quantities that define the fiber. For example, the dimension of a
  fiber can be given as 60/100/200 which refers to a core diameter of 60 micro
  meter, a clad diameter of 100 micro meter, and a coating diameter of 200
  micro meter. 
  Fiber optics is described in detail 
  [here](https://www.photonics.com/Article.aspx?AID=25151&PID=4), for example.
