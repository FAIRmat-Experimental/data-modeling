  A beam path consisting of one or more optical elements.

  NXbeam_path is used in NXluminescence to describe the beam path, i.e. the
  arrangement of optical elements between the excitation source and the 
  sample or between the sample and the detector unit.

(NXbeam_path):
  doc: "Describe the relevant optical elements in the beam path by using
        the appropriate sub classes. You may use as many elements as needed,
        also several elements of the same type. Capital letters in the names
        of fields can be replaced, e.g. lens_NUMBER can be lens_1, lens_2
        or lens_first etc."

  # Should we define intensity (loss), polarization state (before/after),
  #   beam profile etc.?

  # Define or use base classes NXlens_opt, NXfilter (defined), NXfiber, 
  #     NXmirror (defined), NXprism, NXpolarizer_opt (NXpolarizer is spin 
  #     polarizer), NXaperture (defined), NXpinhole (defined), 
  #     NXdisk_chopper (defined), NXgrating (defined), waveplate/retarder
  # Some of the classes might be similar, so one has to decide which one to use

  # [x] Use NXtransformations once (not for each element) and add \@depends_on
  #     to each element which refers to the previous element to define a chain
  #     NOTE: Existing NeXus base classes such as NXslit, NXmirror etc. already
  #           have a 'depends_on' field (but not as an attribute '\@')
  # [x] do not use NXcollection (empty base class; throws an error message)
  # [x] Name elements e.g. "lens_NUMBER" or "lens_INDEX". Capital letters can
  #     be replaced (so we can have lens_1, lens_2, ... for example)
  # [ ] use NXgeometry instead of describing the substrate and coating (or in
  #     addition?) to describe more complex cases (layer structures etc.)
  # [ ] Check already existing NeXus base classes if they properly describe
  #     optical elements
