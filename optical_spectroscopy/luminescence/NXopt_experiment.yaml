      This is an application definition describing general optical experiments.

      A general optical experiment consists of a light or excitation source, a
      beam path, a sample + stage + environment, and a detection unit. Examples
      are reflection or transmission measurements, photoluminescence, Raman
      spectroscopy etc.
      
      This application definition defines:

        * information on excitation and detection
        * description of the beam path
        * sample description
        * N-dimensional data field

        * The identifier is usually defined by the facility or principle
          investigator.
        * The identifier enables to link experiments to e.g. proposals.
