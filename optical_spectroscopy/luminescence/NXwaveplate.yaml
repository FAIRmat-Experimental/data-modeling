# A draft of a new base class to describe a waveplate

category: base
symbols:
  N_wavelength: "Size of the wavelength for which the refractive index of the
                  material is given."
doc: |
  A waveplate or retarder.

(NXwaveplate):
  doc: "Specify the properties of the waveplate."

  type:
    exists: required
    doc: "Type of the waveplate (e.g. full-wave, half-wave (lambda/2), 
          quarter-wave (lambda/4) plate)."
    enumeration: ["full-wave plate", "half-wave plate", "quarter-wave plate"]
    # other types?
  
  material:
    doc: "Specify the material of the waveplate."

  index_of_refraction(NX_NUMBER):
    # do we need a higher dimension (different refractive indices in 
    # different directions)?
    doc: "Complex index of refraction of the waveplate. Specify at given
          wavelength (or energy, wavenumber etc.) values."

    dimensions:
      rank: 2
      dim: [[1, N_wavelength],[2, 2]]
