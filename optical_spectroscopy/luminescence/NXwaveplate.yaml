# A draft of a new base class to describe a waveplate

category: base
symbols:
  N_wavelength: "Size of the wavelength array for which the refractive index of
                 the material and/or coating is given."
  N_wavelengths: "Number of discrete wavelengths for which the waveplate is
                  designed. If it operates for a range of wavelengths then
                  N_wavelengths = 2 and the minimum and maximum values of the
                  range should be provided."
