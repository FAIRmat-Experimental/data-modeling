# 
# [ ] Structure: excitation(+beam path) - sample(+stage) - detection(+beam path) ... all in NXinstrument, or should sample be separate?
#       We could have excitation(+beam path), stage, and detection(+beam path) in NXinstrument and NXsample outside.
#       This (separate NXinstrument and NXsample) seems to be the common way in application definitions.
# [ ] Get in touch with NeXus people and ask how to best proceed: do they suggest to either modifying existing base classes or creating new ones? 
#       For example, NXpolarizer is defined for a spin polarizer, but we would like to use a class for optical polarizers. 
#       Should we create a new class (e.g. NXoptpolarizer) or extend the existing class NXpolarizer so we can use it as well?
# [ ] We could create a base class for optics (optical elements describing a beam path).
# [ ] Would it make sense to create a base class NXstage which could be used in most application def.? 
#       How to they handle this in NeXus? 
# [ ] Which experimental methods (already defined application definitions) are similar to our situation with luminescence?
#       We should ask some people, e.g. Tommaso Pincelli (ARPES, MPES)
# [ ] Should Raman spectrocopy be included? It is very similar to photoluminescence, so it would make sense to incorporate it into 
#       the luminescence app. def. 
# [ ] How to work together? Shared folder? Carola will create a folder on gitlab. 
#       Update: The repositories on gitlab will be moved to github, so we can use github instead.
