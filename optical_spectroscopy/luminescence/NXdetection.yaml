  Description of the detector unit and the beam path between the sample and
  the detector.

  Applications are e.g. luminescence or Raman setups.

    Define the properties of the detector unit and the beam path between the
    sample and the detector unit.
    The detector unit usually consists of a spectrometer, a dispersive element
    or monochromator, and a detector. Describe the beam path between the sample
    and the detector unit using NXbeam_path.

        can be stored in grating_dispersion."
