  Description of the excitation source and the beam path between the source and
  the sample.

  Applications are e.g. luminescence or Raman setups.

  doc: "Define the properties of the excitation source. The user has to sepcify
        at least one of the excitation sources, i.e. at least one of the
        subclasses describing various sources has to be filled out.
        The beam path between the excitation source and the sample should be
        described using NXbeam_path."
