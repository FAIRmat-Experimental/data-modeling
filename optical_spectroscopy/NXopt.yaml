      An application definition template for optical spectroscopy experiments.

      A general optical experiment consists of a light or excitation source, a
      beam path, a sample + its stage + its environment, and a detection unit.
      Examples are reflection or transmission measurements, photoluminescence,
      Raman spectroscopy, ellipsometry etc.

            (bottom reflecting surface) from the stage towards the general
            direction of the light source. The beam comes with angle of
            incidence towards this Z-axis, but in opposite direction, thus they
            are connected with a rotation of 180 - angle of incidence (in
            degrees).

            This transformation brings us from the NeXus to the stage
            coordinates.

            Then provide the set of translations (if there are any). These all
            have a vector defining their relative direction in the current
            coordinate system. (This current coordinate system changes with
            every transformation if you set the parameter 'depends' to the name
            of the previous step.)

                entries of the vector contain the first parameter (a1), the
                second N_measurements/number_of_parameters contain the second

            This field describes the exit window, which is a part of the
            sample stage but might also be considered to be a part of the
            incident beam path described by incident_light(NXbeam_path).
            In the latter case its position within the beam path should be
            defined by the 'depends_on' field which points to the preceding
            element.
