    data.
  N_sensors: |
    Number of sensors used to measure parameters that influence the sample,
    such as temperature or pressure.

    Number of measurements (1st dimension of measured_data array). This is

    was performed at three different temperatures and two different pressures
    N_measurements = 2*3 = 6.

    Number of detection angles of the beam reflected or scattered off the
    sample.

    Number of observables that are saved in a measurement. e.g. two for Psi and
    Delta, 16 for Mueller matrix elements, 15 for normalized Mueller matrix,
    three for NCS. This is equal to the second dimension of the data array
    'measured_data' and the number of column names.

      This is the application definition describing ellipsometry experiments.

      Such experiments may be as simple as identifying how a reflected
      beam of light with a single wavelength changes its polarization state,
      to a variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry experiment.

      The application definition defines:

      * elements of the experimental instrument
      * calibration information if available
      * parameters used to tune the state of the sample
      * sample description

            The stage coordinate system vs. the incident beam. The Z-axis of
            the stage is considered to point along the normal of the substrate
            (bottom reflecting surface) from the stage towards the general
            direction of the light source. The beam comes with angle of
            incidence towards this Z-axis, but in opposite direction, thus they
            are connected with a rotation of 180 - angle of incidence (in
            degrees).

            This transformation brings us from the NeXus to the stage
            coordinates.

            Then provide the set of translations (if there are any). These all
            have a vector defining their relative direction in the current
            coordinate system. (This current coordinate system changes with
            every transformation if you set the parameter 'depends' to the name
            of the previous step.)

            Last, provide the rotations of the sample.

            windows are not the same type and do not have the same properties,
            use a second 'WINDOW(MXaperture)' field.

            The windows also add a phase shift to the light altering the
            measured signal. This shift has to be corrected based on measuring
            a known sample (reference sample) or the actual sample of interest

            should be added in reference_data_link in measured_data.

            The window is considered to be a part of the sample stage but also

      reference_data_link:
        exists: optional
        doc: |
          Link to the NeXus file which describes the reference data if a
          reference measurement was performed. Ideally, the reference
          measurement was performed using the same conditions as the actual
          measurement and should be as close in time to the actual measurement
          as possible.
          For the reference sample, we suggest to use Si oxide on Si (or air
          for straight-through measurements).

    plot(NXdata):

      doc: |
        A default view of the data provided in ENTRY/data/measured_data. This
        should be the part of the data set which provides the most suitable
        representation of the data, e.g. Psi and Delta vs. wavelength and angle
        of incidence. If Psi does not exist, use other Mueller matrix elements,
        such as N, C and S.
      \@axes:
        doc: |
          Spectrum, i.e. x-axis of the data (e.g. wavelength, energy etc.). 
          We recommend to use wavelength as a default attribute, but it can be
          replaced in the case of not full spectral ellipsometry to any
          suitable parameter along the x-axis.
      \@units:
        doc: Unit of the x-axis (e.g. nanometer, Angstrom, electron volt etc.)
