      Determines the measurement geometry.
      This distingushes between van der Pauw and hall bar measurement, too.
      The geometries `square`, `rectangular` and `arbitrary` refer to 
      a van der Pauw type of measurement and the hb-1221 and hb-1311 refer
      to a hall bar measurement in the 1-2-2-1 and 1-3-1-1 geometry, respectivly.
    enumeration: [square, rectangular, arbitrary, hb-1221, hb-1311]

      This refers to the distance between the voltage probe for
      hall bar measurements and to the vertical edge length of the sample
      for van der Pauw measurements.
