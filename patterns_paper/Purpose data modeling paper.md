# Who is the audience?

## IT affine scientists | Ourself and our collaboratours including vendors | Future NOMAD users

* *One part of the audience: People knowledgeable in ?*
* *People have to have development background*
* *General condensed matter physicists and materials scientists*
* Are PIs the target audience of our paper?
* If technical: Audience not general scientists
* Technical people (developers? technical staff?)
* Vendors
* In between IT persons and scientists
* **IT affine scientists** seeking for new methods to work with data
* **Ourself and our collaboratours including vendors**
* **Future NOMAD users**



# What do we want to achieve?

## Report | One example (transmission) | Best practices | FAIR data handling (as our goal) | Our framework | Figures (for describing technical details)

* The paper is a **report** of what we have done
	* Explain how our choices deliver FAIR data
	* Lessons learned (Patterns and anti-Patterns)
* Implementation: A real report of what we have implemented or will implement
* **Examples** (that should be consumable in NOMAD) + READMEs
	* Should be a demonstration of FAIR data handling
	* Simple tutorial like example: Transmission Experiment (Lamp + Sample + Prism + Detector)
* Paper as **best practices** and background information
* Raise the interest in our project and **FAIR data handling**
* Sell **our framework** which helps to create such structures
* Make the FAIRization of data easy with our approaches
* To provide a document with technical aspects and clear guidlines which we can reference later
* Visual representation and clear **figures** for describing technical details



# Shall we split the document/paper?

## Time frame (mid-end october) | Points we already have | First rough ideas paper

* We have a lot of things to discuss
* Focus on the **points we already have**
	* Maybe divide into two categories
* Splitting depends on our **time frame**
* If too technical: Researchers will not be interested
* If not technical enough: Not sufficient for devs
* If we keep the introduction light we can keep it together
* Maybe a **first rough ideas paper** with drafted solutions to the proposed problems
* Just because we haven't implemented something doesn't mean we have to leave it out of the paper
