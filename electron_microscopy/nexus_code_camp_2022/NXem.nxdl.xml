         Application definition for a sample characterization at an electron microscope.
         
         Electron microscopes (EM), whether it be a scanning electron microscope (SEM)
         or a transmission electron microscope (TEM), are versatile tools preparing and
         characterizing samples and specimen. The term specimen is used in this application
         definition it is understood as a synonym for a sample. A specimen is a physical
         portion of material that is prepared and/or characterized in eventually
         various places/positions, so-called regions of interest (ROIs).
         
         Fundamentally, an EM is an electron accelerator. Experimentalists book/use this tool
         in sessions during which they prepare and/or characterize specimens. This application
         definition enables to describe processes, data and metadata for such tasks applied
         to one specimen. Multiple specimens can be described with multiple entries,
         NXentry instances specifically.
         
         There are research groups who use an EM in a manner where it is exclusively operated
         by a single, instrument-responsible scientists or a team of (staff) scientists.
         These users perform analyses for other users as a service task. Oftentimes, though,
         and especially in the case for cutting-edge instruments - the scientists or team
         guide the process while in control of the microscope. Oftentimes the scientists
         operate the instrument themselves and ask technicians only for support wrt to
         service tasks. In all cases, these people are considered users, which may take
         different roles though.
         
         There are similarities and dissimilarities between SEM and TEMs: Both have electro-
         magnetic lenses. These lens may differ in design, alignment, number, and level of 
         corrected-for aberrations. As an obvious difference, TEMs measure the transmitted
         signals. This demands thinner specimens but offers capabilities for probing of
         additional physical mechanisms of electron-matter interaction instead of near-surface
         interactions, i.e. nanometer-scale sub-surface interactions. 
         
         Compared to SEMs, TEMs have a different relative arrangement between the lenses and 
         the specimen; most obvious through the arrangement of the objective lens. Nevertheless,
         both types of EMs use detector systems, which can measure different types of signals
         originating from radiation/specimen interactions. Detectors can also be similar.
         
         Given these physical and technical differences, different instruments have be developed.
         This lead to a coexistence of two broad interacting communities: SEM and TEM users. 
         From a data science perspective, we acknowledge that the more specific a research question
         is and more narrow the addressed user base is who develop or use schemata for
         research data management with EM data and metadata, the more understandable it is 
         that scientists of either community (or sub-community)ask for method-specific schemata.
         
         Researchers who have a single (main) microscope of some vendor in their lab, may argue
         they need an NXem_vendor_name schema or an NXem_microscope_name or an NXem_sem or an 
         NXem_tem schema. Scientists exclusively working with one technique or type of signals 
         probed (X-rays, electrons) may argue they wish to be pragmatic and store only what is
         immediately relevant for their particular technique and research questions. In effect,
         they may advocate for method-specific schemata such as NXem_ebsd, NXem_eels, 
         NXem_edx, or NXem_imaging.
         
         The development in the past has shown that these activities have led to a zoo of schema,
         and implementations of these into data and file formats. There is nothing which prevents to 
         make these schemata open and interoperable. Open here means specifically not that all data 
         showing compliance with/or use the schema have to end up in the open-source domain. 
         There can be embargo periods first of all. Open means that the metadata and associated schema
         are documented in a manner that as many details as possible are open in the sense that 
         others can understand what the (meta)data mean conceptually. The [FAIR](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18)
         principles guide all decisions how data and metadata should be stored.
         
         EM instruments, software, and research are a moving target. Consequently, there is a key
         challenge and inconvenience with having many different schemata associated representations
         of data and metadata for EM research data, especially when data should be processed interoperably
         between software packages. Each combination of schema or an interoperable-made handshake 
         between two file formats or software packages has to be maintained by software developers.
         
         This brings two problems:
         Many software tools and parsers for the handshaking between tools to maintain that come
         usually with a large variety of terminology. If the meaning of these terms is not specific
         and digitally represented, the resulting connections between different data representations
         and the workflows in which these data may not be machine-actionable.
         
         Here a common vocabulary can serve interoperability as developers of schemata and scientists
         can take for instance this application definition and reuse its terms as closely as possible.
         Ideally, they specialize the application definition only for the few very specific additional
         quantities of their instrument rather than trying to reimplement the wheel for descriptions of
         the instrument. This route of more standardization can support the EM community in that it removes
         the necessity for a very large number of schemata. Consequently, fewer possible combinations of
         software tools and version inconsistencies have to be managed and bug-fixed by vendors and the
         community. Aiming for a lower number of schemata serves academia as it enables the EM community
         to focus their software development efforts on those schemata, fixing and discussing them,
         harmonize the common vocabulary used. In effect, everybody can gain from this as it will likely
         reduce the cases in which scientists have to fix bugs in making their own tools compliant and
         interoperable with tools that they wish to use from their colleagues and the wide community.
         
         The here proposed NXem application definition offers modular components which users can
         use as is or extend if their use case is really not reflected. Working towards a common
         vocabulary is a community activity that profits from everybody reflecting in detail whether
         certain terms they use are not eventually conceptually the same as what this application
         definition can already take care of. We are happy for receiving your feedback.
         
         It is noteworthy to understand that (not only for) NeXus schema differ already if at least
         one field is required in one version of the schema, but optional in another version. If group(s),
         field(s), or attributes are removed or added, or even a docstring is changed schemata can
         become inconsistent. An application definition is a contract between a data provider (microscope
         software) and a data consumer (e.g. a scientific software for doing artificial intelligence
         with these EM data). Such changes of a schema lead to new versions.
         
         Tools like NeXus do not avoid or protect against facing these inconsistencies; however NeXus offers
         a mechanism and toolset, through which schemata can be documented and defined. In effect, having an
         openly documented (at case-specific level of technical detail) schema is a necessary but not sufficient
         step to take towards making EM data machine-actionable and interoperable.
         A common vocabulary and a machine-actionable knowledge representation/engine is required.
         Essentially when the docstrings are no longer needed but can replaced by a connection
         to an automated tool which understands what a specific field represents conceptually EM
         data become more generally interoperable EM data.
         
         This application definition takes a key step into this direction. To be most efficient and
         offering reusability the application definition should be understood as a template that one
         should ideally use as is. If required groups, field, or attributes are not needed for a 
         specific application definition 
         
         The use of this application schema should be as follows. Offspring application definitions
         for EM should not remove groups but make them optional or, even better, propose rather
         changes in the application definition.
         
         A particular challenge with electron microscopes as physical instruments are their dynamics.
         To make EM data understandable, repeatable, and eventually corresponding experiments reproducible
         in general requires a documentation of the spatio-temporal dynamics of the instrument
         in its environment that is in most cases neither practical nor possible. For many commercial systems
         specific details about lens excitations may not be retrievable beyond different levels of 
         technical detail. EM experiments by design illuminate the specimen with electrons as a consequence
         of which the specimen changes if not gets destroyed. As such, repeatability of numerical processing
         and clear descriptions of procedures and system setups should be addressed first.
         
         In fact if especially a certain simulation package needs a detailed view
         of the geometry of the lens system and its excitations during the course of the 
         experiment, it is difficult to fully abstract the technical details of the hardware
         into a set of names for fields and groups that make for a compromise between
         clarity and being vendor-agnostic. Settings of apertures are an example where in
         fact aperture modes are aliases behind which an entire set of settings is triggered
         that is often inaccessible for reasons of making EM experiments understandable and
         conveniently executable for many users. The opportunities for application definitions
         to offer an abstraction layer are limited.
         
         Instead, it is for the docstring to specify what is conceptually eventually behind
         such aliases. The design rule we followed while drafting the application definition and 
         base classes is that there are numerous (technical) details about an EM which may warrant
         a very detailed technical disentangling of settings and reflection of numerous settings
         as deeply nested groups, fields and attributes. An application definition can offer a place
         to hold these nested representations at the cost of generality.
         
         Which specific details matter for answering scientific research questions is a difficult
         question to answer by a single team of scientists, especially if the application definition
         is to speak for a number of vendors. What makes it especially challenging if the application
         definition is expected to hold all data that might be of relevance for future questions.
         
         We are skeptical if there is one representation that can ful-fill all these aims,
         while remaining approachable and executable by a large number of scientists in a 
         community. With this application definition we can only motivate the community to work
         towards such aim. While doing so we found that existent terminology can be encoded
         in more controlled vocabulary.
         
         We have concluded that despite all these details of current EM research with SEM, TEM,
         and focused-ion beam instruments, there a clearly identifiable common components 
         and generalizable settings of an use cases of these for which metadata and numerical
         data can be represented with this application definition.
         
         Specifically, this application definition has the following components
         at the top-level:
         * Generic experimental details (timestamp, identifiers, name);
           conceptually these are session details. A session at a microscope may
           involve the characterization of multiple specimens. For each specimen
           an instance of an (NXentry) is created. Details of the instrument have to be stored
           at least in an entry. Other entries should refer to these metadata via links
           to reduce redundancies.
         * Each signal, such as a spectrum or image taken at the microscope should have
           a time stamp and link to the specific settings of the microscope at that
           point in time when the image was taken. The reason is that EMs can be highly
           dynamic and thus physically illuminate the specimen differently or show drift
           during signal acquisition, to name but a few effects.
           What constitutes a single EM experiment/measurement? This can be collecting a single 
           diffraction pattern with a scanning TEM (STEM), taking of a secondary electron
           image for fracture analysis, taking a set of EBSD line scan and surface mappings
           in an SEM, or ion-beam-milling of a specimen for preparing an atom probe
           experiment.
         * NXmonitor instances to keep track of time-dependent quantities pertaining
           to specific components of the instrument
         * NXinstrument;
           conceptually this is a container to store arbitrary level of detail of the
           technical components of the microscope as a device and the lab in which
           it is operated.
         * NXuser;
           conceptually, this is a set with at least one NXuser instance which details
           who operated or performed the measurement. Additional NXusers can be referred
           to in an NXem_snapshot data group to offer possibilities for storing 
           individualized details for a measurement.
         * A set of NXem_snapshot instances;
           each instance is a container to group specific details about the state
           of the microscope when a measurement was taken and relevant data and
           eventual processing steps that were taken.
         * NXdata;
           conceptually, this is nothing more than a reference to some data which, if
           available are worth to be plotted in a default way. A default plottable can be 
           useful for RDM systems to show a visual representation of some aspect of the data.
           It is clear that what constitutes a default plots is a matter of interpretation,
           somewhat personal taste, community standards. In effect, default plottables are
           case- and method-specific. Usually a session at a microscope is used to
           collect multiple signals and images. Examples for possible default plottables
           could be an arbitrarily taken:
           * Secondary, back-scattered, electron image
           * A diffraction pattern
           * An EELS spectrum
           * A composition or orientation mapping
         
         There are a few design choices to consider with sub-ordinate groups:
         * Above images, spectra, and mappings should be stored as NXdata instances,
           ideally formatted in such a way that they can be displayed with visualization
           software that can be specific for the file format in which the data are 
           stored that comply to this application definition. Json, HDF5, XML, or HSDS,
           are examples.
         * Consumable results of EM characterization tasks are usually a sub-set of
           data artifacts, as there is not an infinite amount of possible beam-specimen 
           interactions:
         * Images of electron counts detected in specific operation modes
           (bright field, dark field in TEM, secondary/back-scattered, Kikuchi in SEM)
         * Spectra (X-ray quanta or auger electron counts)
         * These data are in virtually all cases a result of some numerical processing.
           It makes sense to name them with a controlled vocabulary, e.g.
           * se (secondary electron), bse (back-scattered electron), kikuchi, xray, auger.
         
         A key question of asked with EM experiments is how and where the actual (meta)data
         which the application definition encodes are stored (in memory or on disk). 
         To this end the schema, here makes no specific assumptions, not even that all the
         fields/group of a schema instance have to be stored in a single file. 
         The pieces of information can in fact be distributed physically across multiple
         files, at the extreme even across dissimilarly formatted files.
         
         The key point is that the information graph, i.e. how (meta)data are nested, the
         relations between groups, fields and both their respective attributes matches with the
         specifications in this application definition.

                 used for specifying when the experiment was performed - and the exact duration is not relevant - this
                 start time field should be used.
                 
                 Often though it is useful to specify a time interval with specifying both start_time and end_time to allow
                 for more detailed bookkeeping and interpretation of the experiment. The user should be aware that even with
                 having both time instances specified, it may not be possible to infer how long the experiment took or for
                 how long data were acquired.
                 
                 More detailed timing data over the course of the experiment have to be collected to compute this.
                 These computations can take advantage of individual time stamps in NXevent_em instances to

                 Electron microscopy experiments are usually controlled/performed via commercial
                 integrated acquisition and instrument control software. In many cases, an EM dataset
                 is useful only if gets post-processed already during the acquisition or shortly thereafter,
                 i.e. while the scientist is still sitting at the microscope.
                 Many of these processes are automated, while some demand GUI interactions with the control software.
                 Examples include collecting of diffraction pattern and on-the-fly indexing of these.
                 
                 It is possible that different types of programs might be used to perform these processing steps
                 whether on-the-fly or not. If this is the case the processing should be structured with
                 individual NXprocess. If the program and/or version used for processing referred to in an NXprocess
                 group is different to the program and version mentioned in this field, the NXprocess needs
                 to hold an own program and version.

                     the characterization of a single specimen.
                     
                     Details about the specimen preparation should be stored in the

                     Knowing when the specimen was exposed to e.g. specific atmosphere is especially required for

                 Metadata and numerical data of the microscope and the lab in which it stands.
                 
                 The em_lab section contains a description of the instrument and its components.
                 The component descriptions in this section differ from those inside individual
                 NXevent_em sections. In a snapshot only those settings should be stored
                 for a component that are relevant to understand the current state of the component
                 where current means, at the point in time, i.e. the time interval, 
                 which the snapshot represents.
                 
                 For example it is not relevant to store in each snapshot's electron_gun group
                 again the details of the gun type and manufacturer but only the high-voltage
                 if for that snapshot the high-voltage was different. If for all snapshots
                 the high-voltage was the same it is not even necessary to include an electron_gun
                 section in the snapshot.
                 
                 Individual sections of specific type should have the following names:
                 * (NXaperture): the name should match with the name of the lens
                 * (NXlens): condenser_lens, objective_lens are commonly used names
                 * (NXcorrector_cs): device for correcting spherical aberrations
                 * (NXstage_lab): a collection of component for holding the specimen and
                   eventual additional component for applying external stimuli on the sample
                 * (NXdetector): several possible names like secondary_electron, backscattered_electron,

                 An event is a time point/interval during which the microscope
                 was configured in a specific way and the microscope was used
                 to take a measurement.
                 
                 Each NXevent_em can hold an acquisition task with the microscope.
                 For instance the capturing of an secondary electron, backscattered
                 electron, diffraction image, or spectrum.
                 
                 An NXevent_em_data instance holds specific details about how raw data 
                 from a detector were processed into consumable data like images, spectra,
                 etc. These on-the-fly data processing tasks are usually performed
                 by the control software, eventually realized with custom scripts.
                 
                 On the contrary an NXevent_em_state instance holds specific details
                 about if and when settings in the microscope changed

                     A container holding a specific result of the measurement and
                     eventually metadata how that result was obtained numerically.
                     
                     NXevent_em instances can hold several specific
                     NXimage_em_* or NXspectrum_em instance taken and considered as
                     one event, i.e. a point in time when the microscope had the
                     settings specified either in NXinstrument or in this event_data_em
                     instance.
                     
                     The application definition is designed without an explicit need
                     an NXevent_data_em instance that contains an NXimage_* or NXspectra_*
                     instance. Because an NXevent_data_em can be used to document a
                     specific state of the microscope at a time without having it put
                     into the NXinstrument part.
                     
                     In other words the NXinstrument part details primarily the more
                     static settings and components of the microscope as it was found
                     by the operator during the session. The NXevent_data_em samples
                     the dynamics.
                     
                     It is not necessary to store data in NXebeam, NXibeam instances.
                     But in this case it is assumed that the settings were constant
                     over the entire course of microscope session and thus all relevant
                     metadata inside the NXinstrument groups are sufficient to understand
                     the session.
