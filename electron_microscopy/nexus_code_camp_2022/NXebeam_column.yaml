    (NXtransformations):

    value(NX_NUMBER):
      doc: |
        Relevant value from the control software.
        
        This is not always just the diameter of (not even in the case)
        of a circular aperture. Usually it is a mode setting value which
        is selected in the control software.
        Which settings are behind the value should be defined
        for now in the description field, if these are known
        in more detail.
