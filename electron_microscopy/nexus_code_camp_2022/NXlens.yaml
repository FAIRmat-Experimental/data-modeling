  Details of an [electron lens](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-38967-5).
  Eventually a lens consists of multiple components which to resolve from the
  perspective of the application definition might not be of specific relevance
  other than that the lens is a set of optical elements which affect the
  flight path of electrons in intentionally.
  
  For NXtransformations the origin of the coordinate system is placed
  in the center of the lens (its polepiece, pinhole, or another point of
  reference. The origin should be specified in the NXtransformations.
  
  Specifically, a lens-affixed coordinate system should, like all others
  be a right-handed coordinate system whose positive z-axis points in the
  direction of the electron beam.
