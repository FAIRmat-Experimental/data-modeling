  Corrector for spherical aberrations in an electron microscope.
  
  Different vendors use a different naming scheme for the
  spherical aberration factors. It is the users responsibility
  to map to the best matching values.
  
  The spherical aberration corrector is a component in modern
  TEMs that is controlled via instructing the microscope to
  achieve set point values. Users can use the base class as
  a group below which eventually the individual lenses and
  components of the corrector can be specified; however
  usually this is not necessary, most often not even possible
  because of vendor-specific undisclosed details.
  In the case of Nion Co. microscopes the coefficients
  of the corrector can be retrieved, which is why currently
  the Nion convention for the coefficients is used.
