# Microstructures
Many of the everyday materials have micro- and nanostructures within.
It is an important topic to define how we can describe such structures,
and what standard we can provide for experiments
- generating micro- and nanostructures
- characterize micro- and nanostructures.

This requires us constructing descriptions for a broad range of possibilities,
because structures may be regular, periodic, geometrically defined to various
extents (e.g. in one, two or three dimensions) as well as end up bicontinuous
or even more complex.
The separated phases within the material can have all common material states
and be separated by sharp boundaries or continuous transition zones.
