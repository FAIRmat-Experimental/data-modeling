# Microstructures
Many of the everyday materials have micro- and nanostructures within.
It is an important topic to define how we can describe such structures,
and what standard we can provide for experiments
- generating micro- and nanostructures
- characterize micro- and nanostructures.

This requires us constructing descriptions for a broad range of possibilities,
because structures may be regular, periodic, geometrically defined to various
extents (e.g. in one, two or three dimensions) as well as end up bicontinuous
or even more complex.
The separated phases within the material can have all common material states
and be separated by sharp boundaries or continuous transition zones.

# Common properties
Ideally we seek to know the 3D distribution of composition of the sample at
atomic resolution. There is no tool which can span the range from atomic to
macroscopic scale, and such characterization would carry a data load that we
cannot handle routinely so far.

Thus, we need to take simpler measures to describe the samples.

When one tries to characterize a sample under microscale, the first parameter
to tell is a size or size distribution characteristic to the sample. This can
be complemented with characteristic shapes, orientation, and the spatial distribution
of composition.
Especially for porous solid samples (solid / gas interface) one may detect the
specific surface area as an intergral characteristic of the sample.
