# meeting notes 02.05.2022
# discussion about process steps
# homework for next week identify and describe blocks/base classes
- sample:
	
	- if other process step on whole sample --> same sample
	
		
	- process:
		# description of the process including, starting material, pre-process and post-process steps
		   
		- pre-process: 
			# pretreatments: e.g. substrate prepretreatment, target preparation (--> link to setup), preparation of catalysis solution
			
		- growth/process: 
			- substrate or seed material:
			- general process parameters: # paramters that stay constant
			# main proces of sample preparation
			- steps of synthesis process:
				- set parameter values
				- actual parameter values
				- in situ measurement (from link to characterization section)
			
		- post-process:
			# post treatment, sample children, etc.    
			- if sample split --> new sample generated with sample as parent, if possible document how split (e.g. sample)
	

Blocks:
	- chemical
	- instrument part
	- subtrate
